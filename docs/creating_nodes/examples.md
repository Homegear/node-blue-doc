# Adding examples

A packaged node can provide simple example flows that demonstrate how it can be used.

They will appear under the Examples section of the library import menu.

Ideally they should be short, have a comment node to describe the functionality, and not use any other 3rd party nodes that need to be installed.

To create an example, add a flow file to an `examples` directory in your node package. See [Packaging](packaging.md) for more details.

```
examples\My Great Example.json
```

will display as

```
My Great Example
```
