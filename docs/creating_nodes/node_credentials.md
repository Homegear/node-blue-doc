# Node credentials

A node may define a number of properties as `credentials`. These are properties that are stored encrypted separately to the main flow file and do not get included when flows are exported from the editor.

## Adding credentials

To add credentials to a node, the following steps are taken:

### Node definition

First add a new `credentials` entry to the nodeâ€™s definition:

```json
 credentials: {
    username: {type:"text"},
    password: {type:"password"}
 },
```

The entries take a single option - their `type` which can be either `text` or `password`.

### Node template

Add suitable entries to the edit template for the node:

```html
 <div class="form-row">
     <label for="node-input-username"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i> Username</label>
     <input type="text" id="node-input-username">
 </div>
 <div class="form-row">
     <label for="node-input-password"><i class="fa fa-tag"></i> Password</label>
     <input type="password" id="node-input-password">
 </div>
```

Note that the template uses the same element `id` conventions as regular node properties.

### Credential type file

The runtime needs to know the credential types. For this a file named `<type>.cred.json` must be created in the same directory as the code file. I. e. if your code file is named `my-node.php`, the credential type file must be named `my-node.cred.json`:

```javascript
 {
     "username": "text",
     "password": "password"
 }

```

## Accessing credentials

### Runtime use of credentials

Within the runtime, credentials are fully accessible.

#### PHP

You can read the credentials using `getNodeData` with the reserved parameter `credentials`.

```php
$credentials = $this->getNodeData('credentials');
$username = $credentials['username'] ?? '';
$password = $credentials['password'] ?? '';
```

Credentials can be written from the runtime as well using `setNodeData`. You only need to write the credentials that changed.

```php
setNodeData('credentials', ['username' => 'my-user', 'password' => '123456']);
```

#### JavaScript

Within the runtime, a node can access its credentials using the `credentials` property:

```javascript
function MyNode(config) {
    RED.nodes.createNode(this, config);
    var username = this.credentials.username;
    var password = this.credentials.password;
}
```

From JavaScript nodes credentials can be written calling `setNodeCredentials` on the Homegear object:

```javascript
function MyNode(config) {
    RED.nodes.createNode(this, config);
    this.homegear.invoke("setNodeCredentials", [node.id, {username: "my-user", password: "123456"}]);
}
```

#### Python

You can read the credentials using `getNodeCredentials`.

```python
hg = Homegear(sys.argv[1], eventHandler, sys.argv[2], nodeInput)

...

credentials = hg.getNodeCredentials()
username = credentials["username"] or ""
password = credentials["password"] or ""
```

Credentials can be written from the runtime as well using `setNodeCredentials`. You only need to write the credentials that changed.

```python
hg = Homegear(sys.argv[1], eventHandler, sys.argv[2], nodeInput)

...

hg.setNodeCredentials({"username": "my-user", "password": "123456"})
```

#### C++

You can read the credentials using `getNodeData` with the reserved parameter `credentials`.

```c++
auto credentials = getNodeData("credentials");
std::string username;
std::string password;
auto credentialsIterator = credentials->structValue->find("username");
if (credentialsIterator != credentials->structValue->end()) username = credentialsIterator->second->stringValue;
credentialsIterator = credentials->structValue->find("password");
if (credentialsIterator != credentials->structValue->end()) password = credentialsIterator->second->stringValue;
```

Credentials can be written from the runtime as well using `setNodeData`. You only need to write the credentials that changed.

```c++
auto credentials = std::make_shared<Flows::Variable>(Flows::VariableType::tStruct);
credentials->structValue->emplace("username", std::make_shared<Flows::Variable>("my-user"));
credentials->structValue->emplace("password", std::make_shared<Flows::Variable>("123456"));
setNodeData("credentials", credentials);
```

### Credentials within the Editor

Within the editor, a node has restricted access to its credentials. Any that are of type `text` are available under the `credentials` property - just as they are in the runtime. But credentials of type `password` are not available. Instead, a corresponding boolean property called `has_<property-name>` is present to indicate whether the credential has a non-blank value assigned to it.

```javascript
oneditprepare: function() {
    // this.credentials.username is set to the appropriate value
    // this.credentials.password is not set
    // this.credentials.has_password indicates if the property is present in the runtime
    ...
}
```
